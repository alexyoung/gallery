This is a sample Rails gallery application developed by Alex Young (alexyoung.org) for a Linux Format tutorial.

It has:

* Simple photo management with some ajax editing
* Comments
* User management

It's locked to Rails 2.1.1 right now, which is close to the version of Rails released when the tutorial came out.


I've left my working data in there for you to play with, so login with:

admin/test
